- FIXMEs & TODOs in src/ & examples/
- add Doc-str for member functions in all classes
- add Zvbi.VBI_* constants description to doc/ZVBI.rst
- add repr() method for all types
- examples/browse-ttx: make ">>" work for TOP pages
- reconsider zvbi_event_types.c: use "tp_members" to query existing C struct
  instead of instantiating named tuple objects; problem: safety against
  access after limited life-time of C struct
- introduce type for result of get_page_text_properties()
