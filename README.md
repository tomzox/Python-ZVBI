# ZVBI library interface module for Python

This repository contains the sources of the Python "Video-ZVBI" module,
which has its official home at [PyPi](https://pypi.org/). This module
is equivalent to the 
[Video::ZVBI module for Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/Video::ZVBI).

This C extension module provides an object-oriented interface to the
[ZVBI library](http://zapping.sourceforge.net/ZVBI/index.html).
The ZVBI library allows accessing broadcast data services such as
teletext or closed captions via analog or DVB video capture devices.

Official ZVBI library description:

> The ZVBI library provides routines to access raw VBI sampling devices
> (currently the Linux V4L &amp; V4L2 APIs and the FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
> NetBSD and BSDi bktr driver API are supported), a versatile raw VBI
> bit slicer, decoders for various data services and basic search, render
> and export functions for text pages. The library was written for the
> Zapping TV viewer and Zapzilla Teletext browser.

The ZVBI module covers all exported libzvbi functions.

The Python interface module is largely based on objects which encapsulate
the native C structures of libzvbi. Only in the last step, when a Python
script actually wants to manipulate captured data directly (i.e. not via
library functions), the structures' data is converted into Python data
types.  This approach allows for a pretty snappy performance.

Best starting point to get familiar with the module is having a look
at the ZVBI library documentation (generated by doxygen when building ZVBI)
and the example scripts provided in the <A HREF="Video-ZVBI/examples/">examples/</A>
sub-directory: these are more or less direct C to Python ports of the
respective programs in the `test/` sub-directory of the libzvbi source
tree, plus a few additions, such as a teletext level 2.5 browser
implemented in apx. 300 lines of
[Python Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html).

## Module information

Module summary:

* development stage: beta release
* C compiler required for installation
* support by developer
* object oriented using blessed references
* licensed under GPL (GNU General Public License)

Supported operating systems (as determined by ZVBI library):

* Linux
* FreeBSD
* NetBSD
* OpenBSD

## Installation

Pre-requisite to the installation is a C compiler and the
[libzvbi library](http://zapping.sourceforge.net/ZVBI/index.html)
(oldest supported version is 0.2.16, or 0.2.4 when disabling
`USE_DL_SYM` in <A HREF="Video-ZVBI/Makefile.PL">Makefile.PL</A>)
which in turn requires the pthreads and PNG libraries. Once you have
these, installation can be done in the usual steps:

```console
    cd Video-ZVBI
    python3 setup.py test
    python3 setup.py install
```

Note there are no dependencies on other Python modules by the module itself.
Some of provided example scripts however depend on
[Python Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html).

Trouble-shooting note: By default the module compiles against an
internal copy of libzvbi.h and loads symbols added in recent library
versions during module start from the shared library. If your compiled
module doesn't load, try disabling compile switches `USE_DL_SYM` and
`USE_LIBZVBI_INT` in Makefile.PL

## Bug reports

Please submit bug reports relating to the interface module via
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/).

If your bug report or request relates to libzvbi rather than the
interface module, please contact the libzvbi authors, preferably
via the [Zapping](http://zapping.sourceforge.net/) mailing list.
In case of capture problems, please make sure to specify which
operating system and hardware you are using, and of course which
version of libzvbi and which version of Perl and the ZVBI module
respectively.
