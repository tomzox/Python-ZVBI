# ZVBI library interface module for Python

This repository contains the sources of the Python "ZVBI" module,
which has its official home at [PyPi](https://pypi.org/). This module
is equivalent to the 
[Video::ZVBI module for Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/Video::ZVBI).

This C extension module provides an object-oriented interface to the
[ZVBI library](http://zapping.sourceforge.net/ZVBI/index.html).
The ZVBI library allows accessing television broadcast data services such
as teletext or closed captions via analog or DVB video capture devices.

Official ZVBI library description:

> The ZVBI library provides routines to access raw VBI sampling devices
> (currently the Linux DVB &amp; V4L2 APIs and the FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
> NetBSD and BSDi bktr driver API are supported), a versatile raw VBI
> bit slicer, decoders for various data services and basic search, render
> and export functions for text pages. The library was written for the
> Zapping TV viewer and Zapzilla Teletext browser.

The ZVBI module covers all exported libzvbi functions.

The Python interface module is largely based on objects which encapsulate
the native C structures of libzvbi. Only in the last step, when a Python
script actually wants to manipulate captured or decoded data directly
(i.e. not via library functions), the structures' data is converted into
Python data types.  This approach allows for a pretty snappy performance.

Best starting point to get familiar with the module is having a look
at the ZVBI library documentation (generated by doxygen when building
the ZVBI library) and the example scripts provided in the
<A HREF="Video-ZVBI/examples/">examples/</A>
sub-directory: these are more or less direct C to Python ports of the
respective programs in the `test/` sub-directory of the libzvbi source
tree, plus a few additions, such as a teletext level 2.5 browser
implemented in apx. 300 lines of
[Python Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html).
A description of all example scripts can be found in
<A HREF="Video-ZVBI/doc/ZVBI.rst">ZVBI.rst</A>

## Module information

Module summary:

* development stage: <B>still under development, i.e. pre-alpha</B>
* C compiler required for installation
* support by developer
* object oriented using blessed references
* licensed under GPL (GNU General Public License)

Supported operating systems (as determined by ZVBI library):

* Linux
* FreeBSD
* NetBSD
* OpenBSD

## Installation

Pre-requisite to the installation is a C compiler and the
[libzvbi library](http://zapping.sourceforge.net/ZVBI/index.html)
(oldest supported version is 0.2.26) which in turn requires the
pthreads and PNG libraries. Once you have these, installation
can be done in the usual steps:

```console
    cd Video-ZVBI
    python3 setup.py test
    python3 setup.py install
```

Note there are no dependencies on other Python modules by the module itself.
Some of the provided example scripts however depend on
[Python Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html).

## Bug reports

Please submit bug reports relating to the interface module via
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/).

If your bug report or request relates to libzvbi rather than the
interface module, please contact the libzvbi authors, preferably
via the [Zapping](http://zapping.sourceforge.net/) mailing list.
In case of capture problems, please make sure to specify which
operating system and hardware you are using, and of course which
version of libzvbi and which version of Perl and the ZVBI module
respectively.
